- 👋 Hi, I’m Ankit. A Computer Science Engineering Graduate, and a technology enthusiast. What drives me is my passion for innovation and a vision that I very strongly believe in.
I am a people’s person with a firm belief that there is no goal impossible for people with the right attitude and motivation. Many who know me say I am defined by my curiosity and
thirst for learning. I buy more books than I can finish. I sign up for more online courses than I can complete, and my Laptop has a ton of unseen Video Tutorials.
I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things. So curiosity and hunger for knowledge define me.
- 👀 I’m interested in building performant web application and always keen to learn web engineering concepts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Angular/Javascript/Typescript projects
